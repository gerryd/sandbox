The article goes into detail about his ideas for Adminer and how it was designed. Some of this is still relevant today.</p> <p>A major announcement came the following year, with the release of 3.0.0. This release introduced support for multiple database drivers and already included SQLite, PostgreSQL, MS SQL and Oracle.</p> <p>In 2016 the project's source code was moved from its home on SourceForge to GitHub. Bug reports and user forums, however, remained where they were.</p> <p>Finally, in May of 2023, after a long period without released and with user contributions piling up without being merged, a group of individuals decided to join forces and revive the project as AdminerEvo.</p>"},{"location":"#support","title":"Support","text":"<p>The community is available at GitHub Discussions where we discuss ideas and issues.</p> <p>If you would like to report a bug, please look through the open issues or create a new one.</p>"},{"location":"#contributions","title":"Contributions","text":"<p>We welcome pull requests, however we suggest discussing your idea via the discussion board.</p>"}]}
